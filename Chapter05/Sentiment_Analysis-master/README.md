# Sentiment Analysis

I have built a model which will predict the sentiment of movie reviews. I used Naive-Bayes, SVM, and RNN+LSTM based model to obtain really good result.

## Dependency Libraries

* Python 2.7
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook
* TensorFlow
* Keras
