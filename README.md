# Machine Learning Solutions
This is the code repository for [Machine Learning Solutions](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-solutions?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788390040), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Machine learning (ML) helps you find hidden insights from your data without the need for explicit programming. This book is your key to solving any kind of ML problem you might come across in your job.

You’ll encounter a set of simple to complex problems while building ML models, and you'll not only resolve these problems, but you’ll also learn how to build projects based on each problem, with a practical approach and easy-to-follow examples.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
from __future__ import print_function
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

You need minimum 8 GB of RAM to run the applications smoothly. If you can run
code on GPU, then it would great; otherwise you can use pre-trained models. You
can download pre-trained models using the GitHub link or Google drive link. The
links are speci fi ed in the chapters
